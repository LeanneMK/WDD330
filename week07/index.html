        <h1>Week notes</h1>
        <p>I do not have access to sitepoint this week, I have reached out to the bookstore for
            help in accesssing the SitePoint reading. I will be able to access it soon I hope. We met
            as a team and struggled to understand the code requirements. I have gotten a kidney infection
            therefore, I have not had the opportunity to watch office hours yet this week. I will
            try to view them later this weekend after work.

            My team mates are very good at explaining what the code that we are working on means and
            they are great at having me look for the solutions while we are trying to solve the problem
            sets each week, I feel I am learning something each time we meet.

            I had access to the sand box so I played around with the code in there. This is very
            similar to what we did for our todo list last week.
        </p>

        <p>WAI-ARIA Technology Notes
            To improve accessibility, WAI-ARIA provides Web developers with the option to add the<br>
            following semantic information to Web pages and rich Internet widgets which are then exposed to the
            browser:<br>
            <br>
            Roles to describe the type of widget presented, such as "menu", "treeitem", "slider" and "progressbar."<br>
            <br>
            Roles to describe the structure of the Web page, such as headings, regions, search areas and navigation
            areas.<br>
            <br>
            Properties to describe the state widgets are in, such as "checked" for a check box, "haspopup"<br>
            for a menu that renders a sub-menu or other popup and "expanded/collapsed" for a tree node.<br>
            <br>
            Properties to define live regions of a page that are likely to get updates (such as stock quotes),<br>
            as well as an interruption policy for those updates. Assistive technologies may present critical updates<br>
            as soon as they are rendered. However, incidental updates are presented only after completing the current
            task.<br>
            For example, a screen reader informs a user of an incidental update only after it finishes reading the
            current paragraph.<br>
            <br>
            Properties for drag-and-drop that describe drag sources and drop targets<br>
            <br>
            A method to provide keyboard navigation for rich internet widgets.<br>
            <br>
            The combination of these features and the structural information conveyed by the DOM structure allow
            authors<br>
            to produce an interoperable solution to assistive technologies. (Source: WAI-ARIA Overview)<br> </p><br>

        The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads. It is the equivalent to putting the
        following line of JavaScript in main.js :<br>
        document.forms.hero.heroName.focus();<br>
        <br>

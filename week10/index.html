        <p>There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll encounter on the web:
            <br>
            Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in
            many places throughout this module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form
            validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
            <br><br>
            JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable,
            but you need to create it all (or use a library).</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>I found this interesting. Like last week it solidified my understanding that there are multiple ways
            to do these things. I have just now figured out that one way is not necessarly better than another.
            each way of completing something with web design has benifits and draw backs. This is why it is so important
            to have a basic understanding of each process.

        <code>
            <form>
                <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or cherry? (required)</label>
                <br><br>
                <input id="choose" name="i_like" required>
                <button>Submit</button>
            </form>

        <h1>Week notes</h1>
        <p>Let me be honest here, a whole bunch of this stuff went right over my head.
            I read it, I read it again, I am so unsure of what means what, if I could spend
            hours on end looking at code and playing around in the sandboxes I might be able to
            get it through my thick old skull. I will keep putting what time I can find into it, my
            team mates are really good at helping me see where I have missed something so that is great.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I liked the code below because I almost understand how it works now, I have worked with it before
            in other classes and it is starting to make sense, so I chose it as my sample this week.
        </p>
        <h1>Code Sample</h1>
        <p> function amIOldEnough(age){<br>
            if (age = 12) {<br>
            alert(age);<br>
            return 'No, sorry.';<br>
            } else if (age < 18) {<br>
                return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';<br>
                }<br>
                else {<br>
                return 'Yep, come on in!';<br>
                }<br>
                }<br>
        </p>
